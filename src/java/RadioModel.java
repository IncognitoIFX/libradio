public class RadioModel
{
	/*
	 * Initializes the radio model and loads the terrain data. This must
	 * be called before sending any queries to the radio model. Once
	 * initialized, the library can be called from any number of parallel
	 * threads. No locking is required, as once the initialized, the
	 * radio model is immutable (until it is de-initialized using
	 * RadioModel.fini()).
	 *
	 * @param data_dir Path to a directory containing Earth orbit texture
	 *	normal data extracted from X-Plane. This must be assembled as
	 *	follows:
	 *	1) at the top level of the data directory are individual
	 *	   normal map files, name for example: "+30-110-nrm.png".
	 *	   The normal maps can use any internal resolution, not just
	 *	   the stock 1024x1024 shipped in X-Plane.
	 *	2) For each normal map, there can be an optional subdirectory
	 *	   containing water mask shape files. The subdirectory needs
	 *	   to have the same name as the normal map (e.g. "+30-110").
	 *	3) Inside of each water mask directory are 1-degree-sized
	 *	   water mask shape files (also extracted from X-Plane).
	 *	   One tile will typically consist of two files named e.g.
	 *	   "+34-102.shx" and "+34-102.shp".
	 * @param spacing When constructing a terrain relief between two
	 *	radio endpoints, libradio will space the points `spacing'
	 *	meters apart. The denser the points, the more accurate the
	 *	reception model will be, but the longer it takes to calculate.
	 *	If you specify `0' for this parameter, the default is 500.
	 * @param max_pts Maximum number of relief points when the distance
	 *	between transmitter and receiver is very large. The library
	 *	will simply increase spacing between points to keep the
	 *	number of relief points at this number and limit excessive
	 *	amounts of CPU used. If you specify `0' for this parameter,
	 *	the default is 500.
	 * @param max_dist To optimize and speed up lookups for stations that
	 *	are too far apart to ever see each other, this parameter
	 *	the station distance (in meters) at which point the radio
	 *	model simply returns minimum receiver gain. If you set this
	 *	parameter to `0', the default value is 600 km. The minimum
	 *	possible value for this parameter is 2km and the maximum
	 *	is 1000 km.

	 * explicitly dispose of it when you don't need it anymore.
	 * It is safe to call this method multiple times, the radio model
	 * will automatically be deinitialized only once.

	 * Main `worker' method of the model. You call this function when
	 * you want to compute the radio reception level between two points
	 * in space. All positions are specified as geodesic coordinates
	 * (degrees latitude x longitude x meters absolute elevation on the
	 * WGS-84 ellipsoid). Please note that there are no strict
	 * transmitter/receiver roles between the two stations (the laws of
	 * physics are the same no matter which direction you are traveling!).
	 *
	 * @param freq_mhz The frequency (in MHz!) of the radio signal
	 *	being propagated.
	 * @param horiz_pol Flag indicating whether the signal is
	 *	horizontally or vertically polarized. Most signals used
	 *	in aviation (with the exception of DME) use horizontal
	 *	polarization.
	 * @param xmit_gain A base transmitter gain value indicating
	 *	approximate signal strength in dB. Typical values would
	 *	be +40 for a low power transmitter, +50 for medium
	 *	power, +60 for a powerful transmitter and +80 for a very
	 *	powerful transmitter.
	 * @param recv_min_gain A minimum dB gain value before the model
	 *	considers the signal too low power to receive at all.
	 *	These range typically from -70 to -100. These values are
	 *	very transmission method dependent and so need to be
	 *	determined experimentally.
	 * @param sta1_lat Station 1 position latitude.
	 * @param sta1_lon Station 1 position longitude.
	 * @param sta1_elev Station 1 absolute elevation.
	 * @param sta2_lat Station 2 position latitude.
	 * @param sta2_lon Station 2 position longitude.
	 * @param sta2_elev Station 2 absolute elevation.
	 *
	 * @return Signal level (in dB) at the receiver side (whichever
	 *	of the two stations that may be). This will typically be
	 *	a negative value ranging from approx 0 dB to recv_min_gain
	 *	(e.g. -100). If the station is determined to be too far to
	 *	ever be able to be received, this method simply returns
	 *	recv_min_gain as a more efficient shortcut.
